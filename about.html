		<p>Madhya Pradesh can be described as the best state of the nation when it comes to the diversity of its tourism destinations.<br>

Madhya Pradesh is know as the "Heart of India' not only becaâ€‹use of its location on the map, but also because of the lot many things it offers.; it has been home to cultural and spiritual heritage of almost all the religions. Innumerable monuments,intricately carved temples, stupas, forts and palaces are dotted all over the State. The state is home to three UNESCO World Heritage Sites namely Sanchi, Bhimbetka and Khajuraho.<br>

Consisting largely of a plateau, the State has everything- mighty mountain ranges, meandering rivers and miles of verdant forests. But perhaps the best part about Madhya Pradesh is its accessibility. It is equally close to major tourist destinations from all over the country, being the 'Heart of India'.<br>

Development of tourism with public, private partnership in sustainable manner, investor facilitation, skill- development, publicity/promotion of tourist destinations nationally & internationally, identification and development of tourism infrastructure are the core objective of the Board.</p>
